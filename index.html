      <p>I am a junior at Harvard College pursuing a joint concentration in History of Art and Architecture (HAA) on the Architecture Studies track (primary) and Government (allied). 
        My activities in college have been centered around social science research; I am currently a Senior Research Assistant at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science 
        and a Research Associate for the Department of African and African American Studies. This past summer, I was a B.L.I.S.S. (Build Learning through Inquiry in the Social Sciences)
      Fellow at the Harvard Summer Undergraduate Research Village, studying the political, legal, and economic history of medical scarcity in the United States. The urban focus of this
      research has motivated my upcoming senior honors thesis, a mixed methods project between the HAA and Government departments studying the influence of local politics on historic
      preservation of architecture in the American Rust Belt. 
      </p>

      <p>My broader research interests include American urban politics, architectural history, politics on social media, and constitutional law.
        Additionally, I currently serve as the Program Director for WHRB 95.FM, Harvard's entirely student-run radio station. I am 
        originally from Erie, Pennsylvania, my main source of inspiration for my thesis work on the Rust Belt. 
        In my free time, I enjoy singing, playing the saxophone, admiring architecture, hiking Lake Erie, and thrifting furniture.</p>

          <b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/876dr">The Green Transition and Political Polarization Along
              Occupational Lines</a></b>
          (with Vincent Heddesheimer and Erik Voeten). Conditionally Accepted, <i>American Political Science Review.</i>

            Green transition policies set long-term targets to reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, posing a
            threat
            to workers in polluting occupations and communities reliant on these occupations. Can far-right parties
            attract
            voters who anticipate losing from the green transition? We explore this in Germany, which has ambitious
            green
            policies and a large workforce in polluting occupations. The far-right AfD started campaigning as the only
            party
            opposing green transition policies in 2016. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show AfD support
            increased in counties with more polluting jobs after this platform change. A panel survey further
            demonstrates
            that individuals in these occupations also shifted towards the AfD. Probing mechanisms, we find suggestive
            evidence that growing far-right support is due to changing perceptions of social stigma and lower status.
            Our
            results highlight the need for a new research agenda on a backlash against the normative dimension of the
            green
            transition.

          <b><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/hgc2z">Biased Party Nominations as a Source of Women's Electoral
              Underperformance</a></b>
          (with Pia Raffler and Thomas Fujiwara). Conditionally Accepted, <i>American Journal of Political Science.</i>

            What accounts for differences in electoral success between male and female candidates? We argue that parties
            systematically nominate female candidates to districts where the party is less popular, making it harder for
            women
            to get elected. Our empirical strategy uses the German mixed electoral system to create counterfactual
            gender vote
            gaps. These gaps represent the scenario where male and female candidates are nominated in districts where
            their
            respective parties have equal popularity. Using data on all candidates for the German Bundestag across
            eleven
            elections, we document that female underperformance, and its variation across parties and election years, is
            explained almost entirely by women running in districts where their party is less popular. In contrast, we
            find no
            evidence that voter bias or candidate characteristics play a substantial role. Our argument highlights
            gendered
            party gatekeeping that increases in district strength as an important driver of female underrepresentation.

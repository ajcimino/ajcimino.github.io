      <p></p>
      <p>I am a junior at Harvard College pursuing a joint concentration in History of Art and Architecture (HAA) on the Architecture Studies track (primary) and Government (allied). 
        My activities in college have been centered around social science research; I am currently a Senior Research Assistant at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, of which I am an affiliate, 
        and a Research Associate for the Department of African and African American Studies.
        </p>
      <p>This past summer, I was a B.L.I.S.S. (Build Learning through Inquiry in the Social Sciences) Research
      Fellow at the Harvard Summer Undergraduate Research Village, studying the political, legal, and economic history of medical scarcity in the United States. The urban focus of this
      research has motivated my upcoming senior honors thesis, a mixed methods project between the HAA and Government departments studying the influence of local politics on historic
      preservation of architecture in the American Rust Belt. 
      </p>

      <p>My broader research interests include American urban politics, architectural history, politics on social media, and civil rights law.
        Additionally, I currently serve as the Program Director for WHRB 95.FM, Harvard Radio Broadcasting. I am 
        originally from Erie, Pennsylvania, my main source of inspiration for my thesis work on the Rust Belt. 
        In my free time, I enjoy singing, playing the saxophone, admiring architecture, hiking along Lake Erie, and thrifting furniture.</p>

              Occupational Lines</a>-->Decreased Partisanship in the Campaign Messaging of Junior Coalition Partners</b>
          (Working paper, with Congrui Liu)

How does the election season shape the groups and topics that politicians
discuss? In this paper, we demonstrate that electoral campaigns can decrease
partisanship in messaging, depending on the party’s position in government. We
test who politicians publicly talk about by using machine learning (GPT-5) and
manual coding to measure direction of reference of X posts by European MPs from
2018-2020. By analyzing how campaigning affects which parties that a politician
mentions, we find that during the campaign period, direction of reference largely
does not change except among current junior partner parties. Junior partner
parties exhibit messaging patterns during the campaign that focus less on their
opponents or their own party and less on other countries. Our results provide
evidence that the position of junior coalition partner parties during elections—
affiliated with the prime minister yet vying for power independently—leads them
to talk less in terms of partisanship.
